			<div><p class="player" style="text-align: left">DESCRIPTION:</p>
				<p>In Class President, players role-play as high school students competing in their school election for the title of Class President. Over the course of several rounds led by a moderator, players use their identity prompts to build out their characters and dodge rumors as they attempt to prove why they are the best candidate to lead their school (or maybe just why everyone else running is tacky and fake). At the end of the game, the players all vote for one candidate (other than themselves), the player who recieves the most votes claims the title of Class President.</p>
				<p class="player" style="text-align: left">DETENTIONS AND DAYDREAMS:</p>
				<p>Class President is a game of storytelling and improvisation. Players will be challenged to react to an ever-changing landscape of rumors, relationships and gossip as they weave the unique social microcosm that is their high school. Will the shy <span style="font-weight: bold">Chess Club</span> captain who's <span style="font-weight: bold">Always in the Friendzone</span> blossom into the candidate of sexual freedom and drug legalization? Is Chad just running to impress his secret crush and teammate Tyler? Where does the student body stand on open toed shoes in the classroom? In Class President players will be asked to contemplate these questions and more.</p>

					<p class="steps">ASSIGN ONE PLAYER TO BE THE MODERATOR</p>
					<p class="desc">The moderator is typically the player with the best understanding of the rules or has the most comfort leading the group in creating an improvised narrative. The moderator will control the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MWRxNNqgFMPw2J3KVfOYCOvVBUDfikKO5xTgylcPnJ8/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">gameplay spreadsheet</a> and will take notes throughout the gameplay.</p>
					<p class="steps">CREATE THE CHARACTERS</p>
					<p class="desc">The moderator will privately reveal to each player their identity prompt, created by the <a href="chargen.html" target="_blank">character generator</a>. The identity prompt consists of a Zodiac Sign, After School Activity, and Reputation that will be used as the launchpad for each character. If possible, the moderator should send players their identity prompts as early as an hour before the game starts so players can get in the right headspace for their character. The moderator will input these values into the gameplay spreadsheet, which will automatically calculate each player's skills.  During Round 3, the moderator will use the character generator to create a 'bathroom wall' rumor for each player.</p>

					<p class="steps">SET THE SCENE</p>
					<p class="desc">"It was a dark and stormy night and Dylan totally just hooked up with Adrian." The moderator is responsible for bringing players out of the mundane and into the drama-fueled world of the game. At the start of the game, the moderator will introduce the school by answering the questions below:
						<ul class="indent">
							<li>What is the name of the high school?</li>
							<li>Where is the high school?</li>
							<li>What kind of high school is it?</li>
							<li>What is the school mascot?</li>
						</ul> 
					</p>
					<p class="steps">BUILDING NARRATIVE</p>
					<p class="desc">Thoughout the game, the moderator should record any additional characters, relationships or events referenced by players in the <i>moderator notes</i> section of the gameplay spreadsheet. A good moderator will maintain consistency between individual player storytelling and broader narrative arcs by referencing and maintaining these notes - the moderator should inspire creative thinking while ensuring that the school feels like a real, interconnected place.</p>
					<p class="steps">FINAL SAY</p>
					<p class="desc">Although mudslinging, pot-stirring and tea-sipping are all core components of gameplay, the moderator must ensure that all players are given a fair chance to speak when it is their turn at the podium. While one player is speaking, the other players should keep commentary to a minimum. The moderator has final say on interpreting any rules and leading gameplay. The moderator's vote will also act as a tie-break during a split election.</p>

				<p class="crd-title">OVERVIEW:</p>
				<p class="desc"><i>“It’s the weekend before the big election and…”</i> During the role-playing round, the moderator will introduce a scenario outside of a typical weekday where the players can make a <b>big move</b> to secure votes for the upcoming election. This could be a party, town event, festival or any other location where the players may intermingle. During this round gameplay will follow a traditional table-top roleplaying pattern:
						<ul class="indent">
							<li>The moderator provides a prompt</li>
							<li>The player describes an action they wish to take</li>
							<li>The moderator assigns the skill and a success threshhold between 1 and 6</li>
							<li>The player rolls a 6 sided die and adds or subtracts from the roll based on their skills</li>
							<li>The moderator describes the result</li>
						</ul> 
				</p>
				<p class="crd-title">EXAMPLE:</p>
				<p class="desc"><u>ROUND 1:</u> It's the weekend before the big election and Kelly is throwing a huge party. None of the characters are close friends with Kelly directly so the moderator asks <i>"How will you get in?"</i>
				<p class="desc">Player 1 is a Scorpio in the Chess Club so while they may not have the social standing to automatically get into the party, they do have <b><i>+1 CHA</i></b> and decide to try to charm their way in. The moderator sets the success threshold at 3 and the player rolls a 3 which is given a +1 from their CHA modifier. Player 1 manages to sweet talk their way past the door and heads directly for the dance floor.
				<br><br>
				<u>ROUND 2:</u> The players have all found their way into the party. Player 2 (Cancer, Marching Band) has <b><i>-1 ALC</i></b> so the moderator decides that this player finds themselves amongst a group of wily theater kids about to take shots. Player 2 has <b><i>+1 ACA</i></b>, so they descrive a plan to pull out a stray vial from chemistry class and mix it with contact solution to produce a vibrant red decoy shot to take without the repercussions of puking it out in the bathroom. Genius, but will it work?
				<br><br>
				The moderator determines that in this case, the threshold for success is 4. Player 2 rolls a perfect 6. Success! As a bonus, the moderator describes how the dreamboat lead in the school musical gives the player a huge kiss in front of the entire party. Votes secured.
				<br><br>
				<b>These are the kinds of stories that the moderator and participants are encouraged to build through joint story-telling. Leverage the skills you have, and imagine yourself as a character within the narrative.</b>
